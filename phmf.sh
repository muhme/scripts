# phmf.sh â€“ prevent hidden mac folders ".Spotlight-V100" and ".fseventsd" e.g. on a USB stick on Mac OS X
#
# The ".Spotlight-V100" folder on a volume is used by macOS to store metadata and indexing information
# for the Spotlight search feature, enabling fast and efficient searching across the file system.
# 
# The ".fseventsd" folder on a volume is used by macOS to store file system event logs, which track changes
# in the file system, such as file creation, modification, deletion, and renaming, allowing applications and
# services to efficiently update their data based on these events.
#
# Both folders can be omitted e.g. on a USB stick.
#
# run with Volume name e.g.
# $ phmf.sh /Volume/KINGSTON
#
# tested on:
# - Mac OS X Ventura 13.2.1
