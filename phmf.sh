# phmf.sh â€“ prevent hidden mac folders e.g. on a USB stick on Mac OS X
#
# The ".Spotlight-V*" folder on a volume is used by macOS to store metadata and indexing information
# for the Spotlight search feature, enabling fast and efficient searching across the file system.
# 
# The ".fseventsd" folder on a volume is used by macOS to store file system event logs, which track changes
# in the file system, such as file creation, modification, deletion, and renaming, allowing applications and
# services to efficiently update their data based on these events.
#
# The ".Trashes" folder is used to store files and folders that have been moved to the Trash,
# allowing users to recover deleted items or permanently delete them later.
#
# The ".DS_Store" file has custom attributes and metadata for each folder.
# The "._.DS_Store" is an AppleDouble file that holds resource fork information for the ".DS_Store" file.
#
# All hidden folders and files can be omitted e.g. on a USB stick.
#
# run with Volume name e.g.
# $ phmf.sh /Volume/KINGSTON
#
# tested on:
# - Mac OS X Ventura 13.2.1
#
# On Catalina and later, if you get "Operation not permitted" when deleting metadata on removable volumes
# via scipting, grant Terminal Full Disk Access in System Preferences > Security & Privacy.
